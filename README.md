# Spelling-and-Grammar-Checker
A NLP Project for checking spelling and grammar mistakes made using TextBlob and NLTK.This repository contains the code for a Grammar and Spell Checker application built using machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

**Key Features:**

* **Spell Checking:** 
    * Identifies and suggests corrections for misspelled words.
    * Utilizes techniques like:
        * **Edit Distance:** Calculates the minimum number of edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) required to transform one word into another.
        * **N-gram Models:** Predicts the probability of a sequence of words occurring together.
        * **Language Models:** Predict the next word in a sequence based on the preceding words.
* **Grammar Checking:**
    * Detects and suggests corrections for grammatical errors, such as:
        * **Subject-verb agreement:** Ensures the subject and verb in a sentence agree in number.
        * **Tense consistency:** Maintains consistent verb tenses throughout the text.
        * **Part-of-speech tagging:** Identifies the grammatical role of each word in a sentence (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).
    * Utilizes techniques like:
        * **Part-of-speech (POS) tagging:** Assigns grammatical tags to each word.
        * **Dependency parsing:** Analyzes the grammatical structure of a sentence by identifying the relationships between words.
        * **Rule-based systems:** Applies predefined linguistic rules to identify and correct grammatical errors.

**Technologies Used:**

* **Programming Language:** Python

* **Input**: Provide the text to be checked as input.
* **Output:**
    * The application will analyze the input text and provide:
        * A list of identified **spelling** errors with **suggested corrections**.
        * A list of identified **grammatical** errors with **suggested corrections**.
